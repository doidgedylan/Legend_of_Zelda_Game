Specific comments on code quality: The class looks to be cohesive since the methods involved, Update and Draw, have their own specific purposes 
and only contribute to that one purpose. The Update method changes the frames for the animation while the Draw method takes the dimensions and
places the rectangle in the game window.  The class also has low coupling since it references a minimal amount of other dependencies.
Hypothetical changes: The Update method could reference another class to change the animation and/or movement of a sprite so it is more maintainable
and easier to read.  This would shorten this class and only reference one other class to get the information.  It would be an easy implementation
that would help the code for later sprints.
