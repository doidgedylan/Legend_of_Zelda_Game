Evan's Sprint 5 Reflection

At the start of the sprint, we figured out all we had left to accomplish. This was mostly bug fixes and a couple new additions.
This workload wasn't split up super evenly, as some team members had more time and energy than others. More coordination could've
been done earlier in the sprint to ensure that all work items could be completed well, but this didn't occur in time for things to be done
smoothly.
