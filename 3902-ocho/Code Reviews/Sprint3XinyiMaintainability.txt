Specific comments on code quality: The location of the sprite and the spritebatch are passed in as parameters for the constructor.
The Update method is using the frames to animate the sprite, and the Draw method puts it all together to put it into the game.
There is low coupling which will help with maintainability since there won't be as many differences to the dependencies as other
classes.  The class is also concise with each method focusing on their one main purpose to aid to higher cohesion.  Variables are
able to be changed at the top of the class with different values easily and everything is understandable.
