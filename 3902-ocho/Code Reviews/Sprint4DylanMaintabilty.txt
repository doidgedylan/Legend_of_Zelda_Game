Comments:
	-The class is highly cohesive due to the fact it focuses on producing the HUD Background Sprite,
	which helps with maintianabilty
	-The class is easy to read and I know what it does from a glance which will make making changes
	easy in the future.
	-You might want to make the namespace name a bit more tell like IHUDSprite.
