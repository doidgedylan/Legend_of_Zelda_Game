Specific comments on code quality: The class animates and moves the an enemy around the map in the dungeon area.
Based on different positions the enemy can be apart of, the enemy will move in a certain direction.  The variables
used in the class can be easily modified for future maintainability whether someone would like to adjust the speed
or direction of movement since there is high cohesion and low coupling.  Both of these factors open many different
options involving the movement of enemies.
