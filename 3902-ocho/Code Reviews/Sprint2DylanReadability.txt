Specific comments: This class, as a whole, is very easy to understand and read through.
	Additionally, all the other classes in the CollectableSprites folder are similarly easy to understand and read through,
	as they follow similar conventions. The private members are concise and descriptive, the class name is concise and descriptive,
	and the Draw() method is easy to understand and read through if you understand how sprite drawing in monogame works.
