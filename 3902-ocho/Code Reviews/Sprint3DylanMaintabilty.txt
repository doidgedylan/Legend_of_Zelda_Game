CollectableBigHeartSprite seems very maintianable. The sprite class is very cohesive and only serves to update
and draw the collectable big heart sprite. It also has low coupling and does not rely on many external classes
for code. It also follows the same conventions as other sprite classes. Overall no recoomendations really other
than see if the one can use less of the overall classes variables.
