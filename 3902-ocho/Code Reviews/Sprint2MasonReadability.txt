Specific comments: The class is concise where the reader can understand what the main point of it is. There is no way of
telling the difference between the two sprites being used because they are named linkMoveDownSprite1 and linkMoveDownSprite2.
This could be possibly named differently to a starting position and ending position for the movement or just a little more
descriptive as to what they might look like.
