Specific comments on code quality: The class looks to be cohesive since the methods involved, Update and Draw, have their own specific purposes 
and only contribute to that one purpose. The Update method changes the frames for the animation while the Draw method takes the dimensions and
places the rectangle in the game window.  The class also has low coupling since it references a minimal amount of other dependencies.  Update is
reduced by the given classes, ApplyAnimation and ApplyMovement, so it is easier to follow, and someone could change these methods instead of the
update method itself.
Hypothetical changes: There could be a reduced number of dependencies at the beginning of the class to make maintainability easier, but
it depends on what is absolutely necessary versus what is used only to make implementation simpler.
