CollectableArrowSprite seems to be very maintable. It uses an interface that all collectables use, which makes it a standard sprite class.
It also is very cohesive because it just draws the collectable arrow sprite, which is good for maintablity. Finally, it has very low cohesive
because it does not relay on many classes. The only class it uses is the Texture2D class, which is also good for maintainability. The only
suggestion I would have is load the spritesheets via the Texture2D class in the sprite factory and then pass it the texture when the sprite
class is instainiated. This would not be too difficult of a change but may require rewriting other classes.
