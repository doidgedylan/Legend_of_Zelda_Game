Comments: Quality is good, and we can easily manage code and maintenance code. 
The code is simple with a few variables and methods, and with high cohesion with the interfaces and the main class.
Although there are some bigger functions, the switch case make the functions maintainable.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: 
If we add more rectangles for the sprite, the general logic will not be affected.
