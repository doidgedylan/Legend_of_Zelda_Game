Specific comments on code quality: The class is both cohesive and loosely coupled. Essentially, all it does is allow the user to 
	choose which game mode they would like to play. The class only relies on outside logic where absolutely necessary,
	and is very readable.
Hypothetical change and response: The class could become even less coupled if changes to the Game class were made, such as making it
	a static class. But, as the project is currently structured, it's about as loosely coupled as can be reasonably expected.
