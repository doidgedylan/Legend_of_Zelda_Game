Evan's Sprint 2 Reflection

At the start of the sprint, we met up and discussed who would take what jobs, and we agreed on when we'd have them done by.
However, we didn't go into details on how we planned on implementing them, and we didn't really think about how all the pieces would
fit together. Further into the sprint, as things began to come together, we realized there were some inconsistencies within the code
arising from the fact that we had only a loose unified plan. This made the project as a whole take longer, and it was sloppier than it 
easily could have been. We plan to rectify this mistake by meeting more frequently and spending more time coding together, so we can discuss
our team plans as a whole, ensuring that when we finish our individual responsibilities and start to put things together, it will go
much more smoothly.
