Specific comments: The class does not have many varaibles to keep track of which is easier for the viewer to read.
Also, there is only one update method to worry about where a timer is determined, and the spawner will spawn enemies
of a certain type based on the room.  Overall, the class is simple and to the point as to what it does, and it does
it efficiently.
