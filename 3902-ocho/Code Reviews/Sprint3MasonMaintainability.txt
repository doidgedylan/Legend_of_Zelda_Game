Minutes to complete review:
Specific comments on code quality: As a whole, the class is highly cohesive, as it just selects one of two sprites to
	draw based on Link's current frame. The class is also lowly coupled, as it's only dependent on few external classes:
	Link, LinkMoveUpSprite1, and LinkMoveUpSprite2.
Hypothetical change and response: It may be beneficial to make it so that you don't need both sprites to be loaded at the
	same time, on a large scale it may be memory inefficient. However, for the purposes of this project it will almost
	certainly not be a problem.
