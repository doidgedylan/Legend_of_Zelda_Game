Quality of the CollectableFairySprite class is good, and we can easily manage code and maintenance code. 
The code is simple with a few variables and methods, and every function is necessary. 
It also has high cohesion since the functions in it are well defined, and when need to add some method, it is easy. 
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
If we want to change the fairy’s location or add some new features, the general logic will not be affected.
