Specific comments: The class is concise and has understandable variable names for the reader.  There are only three
variables to keep track of and each method is named for the reader to understand without getting lost. Each of these
are also short and only do one thing, so it is simple to follow and know exactly what's going on in each of them.
Keeping track of the health is kept short for the reader with loose coupling and high cohesion.
