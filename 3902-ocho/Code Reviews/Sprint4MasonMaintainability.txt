Specific comments on code quality: The class is cohesive, as it only contains all the logic for a particular type of projectile.
	However, this approach to projectiles may make it cumbersome if we were to add many more projectiles in the future. However,
	the current approach works very well for this project, where there are few types of projectiles.
Hypothetical change and response: To make projectiles more easily extensible, it could be beneficial to use the Strategy pattern.
	In other words, having one projectile class, with settable fields such as sprite, speed, size, damage, etc.
