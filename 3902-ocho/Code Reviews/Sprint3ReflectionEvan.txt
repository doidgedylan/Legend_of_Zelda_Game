Evan's Sprint 3 Reflection

At the beginning of the sprint, we decided what would need to be finished, and who should be responsible for those tasks.
However as we progressed and learned more about the project, these tasks changed, but we didn't smoothly shift
responsibilities with them. As a result, a couple people were left doing a lot of work, while the others weren't left with
much to do. In the future, we must be more adaptable to changing plans and designs, and be more effective at
communicating these changes with one another, so that work may be split up evenly between group members. This may be achieved
through more frequent face-to-face meetings so that we may all discuss challenges about the project, and come to a final group
decision about how we would face these challenges.
