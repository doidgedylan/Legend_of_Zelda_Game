This class is a good readable class. The methods are named appropiatly for their function
and I was able to distinguish what each of the vairables did pretty much immediatly. The 
only change that I would recommend is adding the word "position" or "pos" to the MouseX and
MouseY variable. This was the only variable that I say may need a name change, and it is 
not a difficult change.
