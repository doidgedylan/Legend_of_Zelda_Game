Evan's Sprint 4 Reflection

When the sprint started, we split up the tasks and delegated them amongst the group members. Group members stuck to these tasks
throughout the sprint, as the workload was split fairly evenly. Throughout the course of this sprint, some group members had heavy
workloads from other commitments, and so weren't able to complete all of the assigned tasks. This led, on my part, to rushing and some
sloppily written code, which may come back to haunt us in the future. For the upcoming final sprint, I and the rest of the team will have
to work extra hard to implement all of the assigned features, as well as a couple additional features of our choosing.
