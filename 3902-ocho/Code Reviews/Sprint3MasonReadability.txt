Specific comments: The class has multiple conditions based on collisions that need to be handled
so it is split between four methods based on what the Link character is interacting with.  The main LinkCollision
method is at the bottom of the class which might make it more difficult to read since it is referenced before it
is used, but the method goes through all cases of location and object collision to add to a list and execute.
The execution is also based on the current state of Link which is specified in the case conditions.  The class
covers all cases and organizes them well to give the reader an idea of the process the class goes through each
update.
