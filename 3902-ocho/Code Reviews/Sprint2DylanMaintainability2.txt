Sprint: 2
Name of .cs: CollectableBigHeartSprite.cs
Author of the .cs: Dylan Doidge
Comments: Quality is good, and we can easily manage code and maintenance code. 
The code is simple with a few variables and methods, and with high cohesion with the interfaces and the main class.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: 
If we change the sprite or change the Bigheart Sprite to disappeared in some moments, the general logic will not be affected.
