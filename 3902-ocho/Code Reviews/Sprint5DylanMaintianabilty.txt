Comments:
	-The class is kind of cohesive due to the fact it focuses on producing methods used only by HUD members and those
	methods mostly have to due with obtaining the numbers for links collectables and displaying them in the HUD
	-The class is very easy to read and I know exactly which method does which helps to be maintainted in the
	future
	-The only change is the file needs to be added to the folder namespace.
