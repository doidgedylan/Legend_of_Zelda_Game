	-Overall it looks pretty readable:
		-All the methods are named aproppiatly.
		-Variables seem to be named correctly.
	-I know what each piece of code does at first glance.
	-One change would be in the switch case to change it from using x and y variables,
	to just setting the location vector directly in each slot.
