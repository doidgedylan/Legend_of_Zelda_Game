Sprint Reflection

In the beginning, we divided our resposibilities between each other depending on the tasks in Sprint2.  This was the first time we've started this
process, so it was confusing to get adjusted.  The biggest issue that may have made things more difficult to progress throughout the sprint was not
communicating enough how we were going to implement our parts.  This was an issue because when we eventually did meet to discuss our progess, there
were multiple ways we used our interfaces and update/draw methods.  In the end, it was nothing too detrimental, but we learned that checking in more
often would be necessary.  We also now have a plan going forward to try and make our code the best it can be.  It is good to realize this essential need
for better communication earlier in the project, so it makes tasks a little easier every meeting we have.
