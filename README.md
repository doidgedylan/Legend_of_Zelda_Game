OSU CSE 3902 AU19 Team Ocho
Sprint 3

This is the Legend of Zelda Game Project for Team Ocho in the 11:30 section of 3902 with Matt Boggus.

The last commit for the sprint before adding this readme is e7863ee4a47b7feebcbb5620b598f276d9a380b7.

The program controls are the same to move and attack for link from last sprint. To switch between rooms uses the numbers above the keyboard for rooms 1-10 and the numpad for rooms 11-18.

In order to run the program the files in the LevelFile folder (the files themselve not the folder and the files) need to be moved to the \Legend_of_zelda_game\3902-ocho\bin\Windows\x86\Debug folder. It is recommended this is done in the file explorer. The code should then be run in debug mode.

Using the code analysis tool I got no warnings.
