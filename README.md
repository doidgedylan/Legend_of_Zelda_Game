OSU CSE 3902 AU19 Team Ocho
Sprint 4

This is the Legend of Zelda Game Project for Team Ocho in the 11:30 section of 3902 with Matt Boggus.

The last commit for the sprint before adding this readme is ff0446b0ec8c91e75a67b51b048f07f0cda208ce.

The program controls are the same to move and attack for link from last sprint:
  -Arrows or WASD to move
  -Z for wood sword attacks
  -X to use item
  -C to switch item
  -R to reset
  -Q to quit
  -To switch between rooms uses the numbers above the keyboard for rooms 1-10 and the numpad for rooms 11-18.
  
The title screen and game mode selection screen use enter to move to the next screen and the arrow keys to select the game mode.

Using the code analysis tool I got no warnings or errors.
