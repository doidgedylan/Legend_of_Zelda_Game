OSU CSE 3902 AU19 Team Ocho
Sprint 4

This is the Legend of Zelda Game Project for Team Ocho in the 11:30 section of 3902 with Matt Boggus.

The last commit for the sprint before adding this readme is 29d115f6f9bba954d9183bfeaedaea094dd83a31.

The program controls are the same to move and attack for link from last sprint:
  -Arrows or WASD to move
  -Z for wood sword attacks
  -X to use item
  -C to switch item
  -R to reset
  -Q to quit
  -To switch between rooms uses the numbers above the keyboard for rooms 1-10 and the numpad for rooms 11-18.

This May not be the case but if having trouble, the files in the LevelFile folder (the files themselves not the folder and the files) need to be moved to the \Legend_of_zelda_game\3902-ocho\bin\Windows\x86\Debug folder. It is recommended this is done in the file explorer. The code should then be run in debug mode.

The other issue is the sound. The code for the sound worked on some group members computers but not other. All recommended solutions were attempted with no success. Also, no professor suggested solutions worked either. It is surrently commented out in Game1.cs with a comment denoting it above. It is recommended seeming if your computer will run it with no errors by uncommenting it and running it. If you recieve and error, just recomment it out.

Using the code analysis tool I got no warnings or errors.
