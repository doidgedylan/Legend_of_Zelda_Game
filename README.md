OSU CSE 3902 AU19 Team Ocho

This is the Legend of Zelda Game Project for Team Ocho in the 11:30 section of 3902 with Matt Boggus.

The last commit for the sprint before adding this readme is 504943d07c8ae5988d8aab743dd4034eaac4f0f5.

The program controls are listed on the program, just run it to find out.

There are currently no know bugs that break the code. The couple of things to note is that the animations for Link loop repeatedly after button press, except for moving.

Using the code analysis tool I got two warnings which was suppressed:
Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
